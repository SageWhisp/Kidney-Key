# Kidney Key
RenalKey is an AI-powered renal dosing assistant web app built with Flask and Python. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on 39 official BC Renal Agency documents to deliver accurate, clinical-grade responses to renal dosing and dialysis queries. Clinicians can ask questions in a web-based chat interface, and the app instantly sends summarized results via SURGE/MCP to their mobile devices for quick, on-the-go access.
